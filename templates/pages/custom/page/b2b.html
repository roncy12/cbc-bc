			<h2 class="leading-products-heading">Cold Brew</h2>
			<p>
				Expertly sourced from the coffee-rich regions of South America, Indonesia, and Africa, our Cold Brew coffees are processed and packed in multiple variations including bag-in-box format with 12:1, 30:1, 70:1, and 80:1 ratio and in ready-to-drink bottles for on-the-go consumption. All varieties are high-yield, cold brew coffee in liquid concentrate form, offered in light, medium, and dark roast configurations.
				<br><br>
				Christopher Bean Cold Brews also come in caffeinated or decaffeinated variations to cater to our clients’ need for wider options to offer to their end-consumers and customers. We use high-quality Arabica beans blended with a proprietary extraction process to create premium flavored cold brew concentrates. Customized flavor solutions are also available for business-to-business transactions.
				<br><br>
				Our production quality sets the bar in the coffee industry. All of our concentrates come with a 6-month shelf life. No refrigeration needed.

			<h2 class="leading-products-heading">Coffee Concentrate</h2>
			<p>
				Carefully perfected through years of coffee innovation, our concentrates are the ultimate culinary ingredient for any coffee-centric kitchen. Made from the finest Colombian beans, this liquid coffee in distillate form is processed and packed in multiple variations including bottled format and bag-in-box format with 30:1, 70:1, and 80:1 blend proportions. All varieties are high-yield coffee in liquid distillate form, offered in light, medium, and dark roast configurations.
				<br><br>
				Same as our Cold Brew, our Coffee Concentrate can be stored for up to 6 months even with no refrigeration, giving you sufficient lead time to use up your stocks before reordering.
				<br><br>
				Our coffee concentrates come in caffeinated or decaffeinated variations and work with any brewing system. Packaging is fitted with a Scholle valve connector. Available in flavor and non-flavored versions.

			<h2 class="leading-products-heading">Tea Concentrate</h2>
			<p>
				Powerful in benefits, our tea concentrates offer double-strength brew diluted in boiling water. Our tea concentrate is infused with tea extracts from green and black tea, boasting the same amount of benefits as traditionally served tea. Best for serving in coffee and tea shops, all the measuring, timing, and straining are done beforehand—it’s essentially a dilute-and-serve tea.
				<br><br>
				Christopher Bean’s tea concentrates are expertly brewed from single-origin tea extract sourced from the finest tea-producing regions around the world. We offer a wide range of essences, extracts, and concentrates in white, green, and black tea varieties as well as some common herbal profiles.
				<br><br>
				If you’re a business looking for tea-based products, say hello to us here and let’s talk about how we can customize our solutions to fit your needs.
